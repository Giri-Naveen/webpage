            At Splitvest, we’re reimagining real estate investing for the modern Indian. Our mission is 
            simple yet powerful: to make premium property ownership accessible to all, not just the wealthy few.
          </p>

          <p className="text-[#B4B4CC] mt-5 leading-relaxed text-[16px] md:text-[17px] tracking-wide">
            Splitvest allows you to invest in high-value real estate through fractional ownership—starting small 
            and earning monthly rental income, typically offering average returns of around 3% annually, without 
            the financial strain of full property ownership. By leveraging blockchain and NFT-based tokenization, 
            we bring unmatched transparency, liquidity, and security to your investments.
          </p>

          <p className="text-[#B4B4CC] mt-5 text-[16px] md:text-[17px] tracking-wide leading-relaxed">
            But Splitvest is more than just technology. It’s a movement inspired by real-world frustration. 
            The idea was born from the struggle of trying to invest in real estate with limited capital—facing 
            barriers like high entry costs, complex paperwork, and little flexibility. Instead of giving up, a 
            vision was formed to build a smarter, tech-driven alternative.
          </p>

          <p className="text-[#B4B4CC] mt-5 text-[16px] md:text-[17px] tracking-wide leading-relaxed">
            With a dedicated team of experts in finance, real estate, and Web3, Splitvest was created to bridge 
            the gap between everyday investors and premium property assets. What started as a personal challenge 
            has grown into a national opportunity—to democratize real estate wealth, one fraction at a time.
          </p>

          <p className="text-[#B4B4CC] mt-5 text-[16px] md:text-[17px] tracking-wide leading-relaxed">
            Whether you're looking to build passive income or diversify your portfolio, Splitvest gives you the tools 
            and access to make smarter real estate investments—with ease, trust, and clarity.
          </p>
